Hugo is a static site generator that claims to be "The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites". It allows developers to create static websites that don't rely on infrastructure such as databases or server-side code. It is designed to be easy to use and highly customizable, making it a popular choice among developers who need to create fast and efficient websites quickly. In this post, we'll take a closer look at what Hugo is, how it works, and the benefits and drawbacks it offers compared to other static site generators.

## What is Hugo?

Hugo is an open-source static site generator written in Go. It was created by Steve Francia in 2013, and since then, it has gained popularity among developers for its ability to generate entire websites in less than a few seconds. Hugo has a built-in content management system that works by generating static HTML pages from Markdown files, which can then be deployed to a web server or content delivery network (CDN). It also has a built-in template system built on top of Go's HTML and text template systems.

## How does Hugo work?

When creating a new Hugo site, you start by creating a new project and editing the templates in your layouts folder to set the overall structure for your static website. It's usually easier to start off with a theme and modify the templates to your needs, since by default the layouts folder is empty.

***Hugo's [quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) recommends starting off with theme as well.***

In the layouts folder, you can also define partials that you can include anywhere on your pages without having to write them over and over again. Things like the navigation menu, footer, and sidebar.

Then you create your pages by creating markdown files in the content folder. The directory structure of your content folder determines the structure of your website. Keep that in mind when deciding where to put your content. Hugo uses these files along with the templates in the layouts folder to generate HTML pages. The templates are applied based on [Hugo's lookup order](https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/).

***You can view your site locally at any time by running the `hugo server` command on the command line and opening a browser to [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/).***

When you are ready to publish, you can simply run the `hugo` command, and Hugo will publish your website to the public folder in your project directory. There are also integrations with plenty of common hosting providers that will allow you to deploy your site directly using the `hugo deploy` command.

Hugo can also generate RSS feeds, sitemaps, manifests, and plenty of other common files for your new site. That can all be configured using the Hugo configuration file.

## What are the benefits of using Hugo?

There are several benefits to using Hugo as a static site generator.

First, it is incredibly fast and easy to use. Since it generates static HTML files, there is no need for a database or server-side code, which can slow down a site's performance. You can quickly create new static websites and pages using Markdown files and built-in templates. Hugo even has several themes available on their website which you can easily apply by copying them to the themes folder.

Second, it is highly customizable. You can create your own templates or use third-party templates to create unique and visually appealing websites. If you decide to use a theme, you can easily extend or override any of the theme templates to suit your needs.

Third, it is a free and open-source project. All the source code is available on their GitHub repository. There is a community of developers that are constantly working on making sure Hugo keeps improving and any issues that come up are resolved quickly.

## What are the drawbacks of using Hugo?

While there are many benefits to using Hugo, there are also some drawbacks to consider.

First, it may not be the best choice for large or complex websites. While it is possible to create complex websites with Hugo, it doesn't come with the functionality of content management systems like WordPress. WordPress comes with the benefits of a database, server-side code, and an entire ecosystem of plugins to build almost any kind of website.

Second, it can be difficult to set up for developers who are not familiar with HTML templates. From personal experience, understanding Hugo's template system was very confusing when I first began creating this blog. Hugo's documentation definitely helped, but there was a lot that I learned through trial and error.

Third, because it generates static HTML files, it is not the best choice for websites that require dynamic content. If your website requires a page to change depending on who's using it, then that is better suited to a server-side framework.

## What are some alternative static site generators?

There are many other static site generators available, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks. Some popular alternatives to Hugo include Jekyll, Gatsby, and Next.js.

### Jekyll

Compared to Jekyll, Hugo is generally faster, but more complicated to set up initially. GitHub Pages has built-in support for Jekyll and if you are looking for the quickest way to get a site up and running, this is probably the way to go. That said, Github Pages has limits on what type of websites you can build. For anything that isn't a hobby, you would need a different hosting provider which brings Jekyll in line with Hugo. Considering your site will probably grow over time, Hugo's speed advantage can become significant and may be worth the initial setup time.

### Gatsby

Gatsby is built on top of React and GraphQL, which can make it more powerful for creating dynamic websites. Gatsby also has a plugin library with over 3000 plugins that provide a lot of extra features. However, Gatsby requires more knowledge of React than Hugo requires knowledge of Go. If you know React or want to learn, then Gatsby can be a great choice. However, I would argue that Hugo's template system is easier to pick up than React.

### Next.js

Next.js is built on top of React and Node.js. Similar to Gatsby, it can be more powerful than Hugo for creating dynamic websites and requires knowledge of React. It supports both static site generation as well as server-side rendering. It really comes down to what your needs are for a website. While Next.js supports static sites, if you aren't going to use many of the features that React and Node provide, a Hugo website is more than capable of providing a great user and developer experience.

## Conclusion

Hugo is a fast and efficient static site generator that is popular among developers who need to create websites quickly and easily. While it may not be the best choice for every project, it offers many benefits over other static site generators, including speed, ease of use, and customization options. I hope this article helped you understand the advantages and disadvantages of Hugo so that you can choose the right framework for your next website.
