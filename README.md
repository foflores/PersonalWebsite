## About The Project

Django is a popular, well documented framework for creating web apps. I created this website to learn how to properly use Django and the fundamentals of web development.

For now, I am using the website as a blog to post what projects I am working on. However, I am planning on adding more functionality over time.

The website is currently deployed [here](https://www.foflores.com) using Nginx and uWSGI on a linux server.
